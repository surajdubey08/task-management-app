# Database Backup and Recovery Strategy for TaskFlow

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy for the TaskFlow application database across different environments and database providers.

## Backup Strategy

### 1. Backup Types

#### Full Backups
- Complete copy of the database
- Scheduled: Daily at 2:00 AM
- Retention: 30 days
- Stored: Local storage and cloud storage (S3/GCS)

#### Incremental Backups
- Changes since last full backup
- Scheduled: Every 4 hours
- Retention: 7 days
- Stored: Local storage

#### Transaction Log Backups (PostgreSQL/SQL Server)
- Transaction log entries
- Scheduled: Every 15 minutes
- Retention: 24 hours
- Stored: Local storage

### 2. Environment-Specific Backup Configuration

#### Development Environment
- Local SQLite file backups
- Automated backup on application shutdown
- Simple file copy strategy
- No off-site storage

#### Staging Environment
- Database provider specific backups
- Daily full backups
- Weekly off-site storage
- 7-day retention

#### Production Environment
- Database provider specific backups
- Daily full backups
- Hourly incremental backups
- 15-minute transaction log backups (if supported)
- 30-day retention for full backups
- 7-day retention for incremental backups
- Off-site storage with encryption

## Recovery Strategy

### 1. Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Maximum data loss: 1 hour
- Achieved through frequent incremental backups
- Transaction log backups for minimal data loss

### 2. Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Maximum downtime: 4 hours
- Automated recovery procedures
- Pre-tested recovery scripts
- Standby database instances

### 3. Recovery Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Accidental Data Deletion
- Identify time of deletion
- Restore from last full backup before deletion
- Apply incremental backups up to deletion time
- Apply transaction logs up to required point

#### Scenario 2: Database Corruption
- Verify corruption with database consistency checks
- Restore from last known good backup
- Apply incremental backups
- Validate data integrity

#### Scenario 3: Complete System Failure
- Deploy new database instance
- Restore latest full backup
- Apply all incremental backups
- Apply transaction logs
- Validate application functionality

## Implementation for Different Database Providers

### SQLite Implementation

#### Backup Process
```bash
# Simple file copy backup
cp /app/data/taskmanagement.db /backups/taskmanagement_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db

# Compressed backup
sqlite3 /app/data/taskmanagement.db ".backup /tmp/backup.db" && \
gzip -c /tmp/backup.db > /backups/taskmanagement_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db.gz && \
rm /tmp/backup.db
```

#### Recovery Process
```bash
# Stop application
# Restore from backup
cp /backups/taskmanagement_20250903_140000.db.gz /tmp/restore.db.gz
gunzip /tmp/restore.db.gz
mv /tmp/restore.db /app/data/taskmanagement.db
# Start application
```

### PostgreSQL Implementation

#### Backup Process
```bash
# Full backup using pg_dump
pg_dump -h localhost -U taskflow_user -d taskmanagement -F c -f /backups/taskmanagement_full_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump

# Incremental backup using WAL archiving
# Configure in postgresql.conf:
# wal_level = replica
# archive_mode = on
# archive_command = 'cp %p /wal_archive/%f'
```

#### Recovery Process
```bash
# Stop PostgreSQL service
# Restore base backup
pg_restore -h localhost -U taskflow_user -d taskmanagement /backups/taskmanagement_full_20250903_140000.dump

# Apply WAL logs if needed
# Start PostgreSQL service
```

### SQL Server Implementation

#### Backup Process
```sql
-- Full backup
BACKUP DATABASE [TaskManagement] 
TO DISK = N'/backups/TaskManagement_Full_$(date).bak' 
WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT, NAME = 'TaskManagement-Full Database Backup'

-- Transaction log backup
BACKUP LOG [TaskManagement] 
TO DISK = N'/backups/TaskManagement_Log_$(date).trn' 
WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT, NAME = 'TaskManagement-Transaction Log Backup'
```

#### Recovery Process
```sql
-- Restore full backup
RESTORE DATABASE [TaskManagement] 
FROM DISK = N'/backups/TaskManagement_Full_20250903_140000.bak' 
WITH FILE = 1, NORECOVERY, NOUNLOAD, STATS = 5

-- Restore transaction log
RESTORE LOG [TaskManagement] 
FROM DISK = N'/backups/TaskManagement_Log_20250903_141500.trn' 
WITH FILE = 1, NOUNLOAD, STATS = 10

-- Complete recovery
RESTORE DATABASE [TaskManagement] WITH RECOVERY
```

## Automation Scripts

### Backup Automation Script (backup.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
BACKUP_DIR="/backups"
DATABASE_NAME="taskmanagement"
DATABASE_USER="taskflow_user"
RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Get current timestamp
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# Perform backup based on database provider
case $DATABASE_PROVIDER in
  "SQLite")
    cp /app/data/$DATABASE_NAME.db $BACKUP_DIR/${DATABASE_NAME}_${TIMESTAMP}.db
    ;;
  "PostgreSQL")
    pg_dump -U $DATABASE_USER -d $DATABASE_NAME -F c -f $BACKUP_DIR/${DATABASE_NAME}_full_${TIMESTAMP}.dump
    ;;
  "SQLServer")
    # SQL Server backup command would go here
    ;;
esac

# Remove old backups
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "${DATABASE_NAME}*" -mtime +$RETENTION_DAYS -delete

# Log backup completion
echo "Backup completed at $(date)" >> /var/log/backup.log
```

### Recovery Automation Script (restore.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
BACKUP_DIR="/backups"
DATABASE_NAME="taskmanagement"
DATABASE_USER="taskflow_user"
BACKUP_FILE=$1

# Validate backup file
if [ ! -f "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Backup file not found: $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE"
  exit 1
fi

# Stop application services
docker-compose stop api

# Perform restore based on database provider
case $DATABASE_PROVIDER in
  "SQLite")
    cp $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE /app/data/$DATABASE_NAME.db
    ;;
  "PostgreSQL")
    pg_restore -U $DATABASE_USER -d $DATABASE_NAME $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE
    ;;
  "SQLServer")
    # SQL Server restore command would go here
    ;;
esac

# Start application services
docker-compose start api

echo "Restore completed from $BACKUP_FILE"
```
