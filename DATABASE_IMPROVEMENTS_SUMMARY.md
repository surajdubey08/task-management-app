## Implementation Status

### Completed âœ…
- Migration framework implementation
- Multi-environment database support
- Automated seeding integration
- Backup/recovery documentation
- Usage documentation
- Code changes

### In Progress ðŸ”„
- Testing in staging environment
- Performance benchmarking
- Security assessment

### Planned ðŸ”®
- Automated backup implementation
- Monitoring dashboard setup

- Point-in-time recovery

## Next Steps

1. Test migrations in staging environment
2. Implement automated backup solution
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Conduct security review
5. Document advanced recovery procedures
6. Create performance benchmarking tests

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered with the database improvements:

1. Revert Program.cs changes to remove automatic migration execution
2. Use previous database files for SQLite
3. Restore database from last known good backup
4. Revert to previous docker-compose configuration
5. Notify development team of rollback
